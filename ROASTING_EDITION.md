- "Nice start! Only X more to go. Piece of cake, right?"

**Some Progress (20-40%):**
- "Slow and steady... very slow."
- "Started strong... then what happened?"

**Halfway There (40-60%):**
- "Finally! Some actual effort!"
- "Halfway? Not even close. But hey, keep the momentum!"

**Getting Close (60-80%):**
- "Okay, now we're cooking!"
- "You're actually doing this! Time spent = episodes of anime sacrificed!"

**Almost Done (80-99%):**
- "SO CLOSE! Don't give up now!"
- "Almost there! Don't choke now!"

**Complete (100%):**
- "ABSOLUTE LEGEND! Go ace that exam!"
- "ALL TOPICS CONQUERED! You absolute madlad! Time to destroy that exam!"

**Stats Section - "THE DAMAGE REPORT":**
